 Instructions:
 * Put file name and file extension
 * run, click on image multiple times
 * each click separately saves a new file
 * press any key or close the window to exit
 
 
Tips:
 * Even if you don't change any settings, every new session will still produce unique results
 * Set direction to vertical or horizontal. 
 * set threshold value for mild or strong effect
 * Toggle reverseMode to true or false if you want the pixels to go in the opposite direction
 * set mode to 0,1 or 2 to target only the white/midtone/black pixels
 * If you want the pixels to go in more than 1 direction, feed the previous result as input, change the direction settings and apply, you can build up complex effects this way
